# tomago-sdk-go

Tomago is a project code name, which is used to wrap SmartContract invocation
from the business point of view, including APIs for digital assets, proof of
existence (POE), signing contract, supply chain, etc. You need not care
about how the backend blockchain runs or the unintelligible techniques, such as
consensus, endorsement and decentralization. Simply use the SDK we provid to
implement your business logics, we will handle the caching, tagging, compressing
, encrypting and high availability.
